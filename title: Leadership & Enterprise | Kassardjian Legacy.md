<h1>Leadership & Enterprise Authority</h1>

<p><strong>Haroutune Kassardjian</strong>, heir of <strong>Aksor Kassardjian</strong>, presently directs and commands the Kassardjian enterprises operating between the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> and <strong>Ghana</strong>.</p>

<p>The Kassardjian enterprises are organised and executed through two principal arms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Drake Exports Ltd</strong> — United Kingdom</li>
  <li><strong>Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited</strong> — Ghana</li>
</ul>

<p>This structure is deliberate and authoritative, reflecting a defined division of capital command and operational execution.</p>

<h2>United Kingdom Arm</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom arm, conducted through <strong>Drake Exports Ltd</strong>, constitutes the financial and strategic centre of the enterprise. From London, capital is deployed, government projects are financed, and supply mandates are structured and underwritten.</p>

<p>Drake Exports Ltd does not operate as a passive intermediary. It functions as a financing principal, advancing capital and enabling execution beyond routine documentary instruments.</p>

<h2>Ghana Arm</h2>

<p>The Ghana arm, conducted through <strong>Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited</strong>, serves as the principal operational and contractual authority. All substantive contracts, delivery, and execution are administered on the ground through this entity.</p>

<h2>Operating Doctrine</h2>

<p>The Kassardjian enterprises do not confine themselves to letters of credit or routine guarantees. Where required, ministries are financed directly through <strong>Drake Exports Ltd</strong>, with execution carried out by <strong>Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited</strong>.</p>

<p>This doctrine reflects a capital-first, execution-assured model of enterprise.</p>
