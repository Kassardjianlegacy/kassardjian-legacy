# Leadership & Enterprise

**Haroutune Kassardjian**, heir of **Aksor Kassardjian**, leads the Kassardjian family enterprises operating across the **United Kingdom and Ghana**.

The enterprise structure is anchored by two principal entities:

- **Drake Exports Ltd** (United Kingdom)  
- **Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited** (Ghana)

The **United Kingdom arm**, operating through Drake Exports Ltd, functions as the group’s **financing, structuring, and sourcing platform**. Its mandate includes the financing of government-linked projects, balance-sheet structuring, and the sourcing of strategic supply for ministerial and institutional counterparties.

The **Ghana arm**, operating through Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited, serves as the **principal operational hub and contractual execution entity**, responsible for on-ground operations, project delivery, and direct contractual engagement with ministries and public institutions.

Under the leadership of Haroutune Kassardjian, the group does not operate on the basis of conventional documentary instruments alone. The Kassardjian enterprises do not rely on letters of credit or routine guarantees. Where appropriate, **ministries are financed directly through Drake Exports Ltd**, enabling supply execution under structured financing arrangements aligned with government project requirements.

This structure reflects a vertically integrated enterprise model combining financing capacity, operational execution, and institutional governance.
