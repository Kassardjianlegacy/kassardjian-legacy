  <p>In the 1930s, during the British era of the Gold Coast of Africa, <strong>Aksor Kassardjian</strong> began building the foundation of what would become one of the most influential family legacies in Ghana. He developed deep networks with fellow merchant elites including the <em>Kalenderians</em> and the <em>Kalmouni family</em>, entering business with trust and strength.</p>

  <p>Following Ghana’s independence in 1957, Aksor was invited to state ceremonies during the visit of <strong>Queen Elizabeth II and the King of the United Kingdom</strong>, recognized as a top national contractor. The royal family had already known and respected him since the early 1950s.</p>

  <p>Through <strong>Kassardjian Construction Ghana Ltd.</strong>, Aksor led the construction of Ghana’s core infrastructure including highways from <em>Tamale to Accra</em>, <em>Kumasi to Tamale</em>, and back to Accra. He held exclusive rights to supply <strong>JCB</strong> and <strong>Caterpillar (CAT)</strong> machinery, delivering directly to government projects.</p>

  <p>He was revered by Ghanaian presidents from <strong>Dr. Kwame Nkrumah</strong> onward, often called upon personally for government-level deals. No one dared to challenge Aksor’s integrity, reach, or efficiency.</p>

  <p>Beyond business, Aksor founded the <strong>Kassardjian School in Tamale</strong>, offering free education to children in need. Known for his generous heart, he frequently supported ministries with equipment and aid—always for the betterment of national service.</p>
