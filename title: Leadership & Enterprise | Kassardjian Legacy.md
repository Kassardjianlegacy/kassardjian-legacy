# Leadership & Enterprise Authority

**Haroutune Kassardjian**, heir of **Aksor Kassardjian**, presently directs and commands the Kassardjian enterprises operating between the **United Kingdom** and **Ghana**.

The Kassardjian enterprises are organised and executed through two principal arms:

- **Drake Exports Ltd** — United Kingdom  
- **Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited** — Ghana  

This structure is neither incidental nor provisional. It reflects a deliberate division of authority, function, and capital deployment.

## United Kingdom Arm

The United Kingdom arm, conducted through **Drake Exports Ltd**, constitutes the **financial and strategic centre** of the enterprise. From London, Drake Exports undertakes the financing of government projects, the structuring of supply mandates, and the mobilisation of capital and material resources.

Drake Exports does not exist merely to intermediate transactions. It operates as a **financing principal**, advancing capital, arranging supply, and underwriting execution where required. Ministries supplied under this framework are not treated as counterparties dependent upon routine instruments, but as institutions financed and enabled through structured arrangements.

## Ghana Arm

The Ghana arm, conducted through **Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited**, serves as the **principal operational and contractual authority** of the enterprise. It is responsible for execution on the ground, contractual performance, delivery, and operational command.

All substantive contracts, operational undertakings, and project execution are administered through this entity, ensuring direct control, accountability, and continuity.

## Operating Doctrine

Under the leadership of Haroutune Kassardjian, the Kassardjian enterprises do not confine themselves to the passive mechanics of letters of credit or conventional guarantees. Where circumstances require, **ministries are financed directly through Drake Exports Ltd**, with supply executed through Kassardjian Crude Ghana Limited.

This doctrine reflects a long-form approach to enterprise: capital first, execution assured, authority retained.

## Continuity

This structure represents a unified system of finance, supply, and command, maintained with discipline and intent, and aligned with legacy standards of enterprise governance.
